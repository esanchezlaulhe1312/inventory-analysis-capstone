### Business Challenge 
A UK beverage distributor faced a **critical inventory management crisis**: 
- Widespread stockouts affecting customer satisfaction 
- Excessive inventory accumulation tying up working capital 
- No systematic approach to inventory optimization 
- 80 retail locations with inconsistent stock management 
 
### Technical Challenge & Recovery 
**The Reality of Data Projects:** This project included a complete restart of Phase 3 due to over-complex architecture. 
 
**What went wrong:** Initial approach used 6+ dimension tables creating calculation inconsistencies. 
 
**The solution:** Simplified to 3 core tables (inventory dimension, sales transactions, purchase orders) enabling reliable analysis. 
 
**Key learning:** Sometimes the best technical decision is to restart with a better architecture. 
 
### Final Solution 
Data-driven optimization framework delivering: 
- **Immediate actions** for 35.4% of SKUs at stockout risk 
- **Working capital recovery** from $28.8M excess inventory 
- **Strategic procurement** improvements with vendor analysis 
- **Automated monitoring** through executive dashboards
